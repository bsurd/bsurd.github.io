   Starting out, back in 2016, I had little to no experience working in the industry. During my first year here I started learning the basics of how to report bugs, creating test cases, and what a test plan is and should contain.

   Fast forward about a year and a half into the industry, I've managed to work with several other different technologies and platforms, improving on existing and new skills. Learned some basic <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>C#</mark>, <mark>Bash</mark> and <mark>Java</mark> needed for testing purposes as I was testing mobile apps that had a website and DB component to them as well.

   After doing a project change I've started on polishing my known skills and working on leadership, while also expanding what I know about <mark>Java</mark> and <mark>Selenium</mark> in order to advance from manual to automation.

     - Documenting how to set up and use project-specific tools
     - Experienced with agile methodology (scrum and kanban)
     - Talking with the clients, proposing test plan strategies and resource allocation 
     - Technical interviews for hiring new employees
